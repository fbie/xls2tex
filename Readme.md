# XLS 2 TeX #

A simple and incomplete tool to convert XLS formatted spreadsheets into nice looking TeX tables. Very much work in progress.

## Why Does Anyone Need This? ##

I work on the experimental [Funcalc](http://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/funcalc/) spreadsheet engine  as part of my PhD project and typing spreadsheets in Latex by hand is boring.

## Left To Do ##

 - [ ] Fix string quoting in TeX output.
 - [ ] Add margin coloring for interpreted and compiled sheets.
 - [ ] Add input, output and intermediate cell coloring.
 - [ ] Allow for specifying a cell range to display.
